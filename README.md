# Docker Networking Guide 🐳

In Docker, every container is assigned its own IP address. If you want containers to communicate with each other, they must be on the **same network**. Docker's networking feature allows you to create and manage networks to link containers. Let's explore some essential Docker networking commands and concepts.

---

### 🛠️ **Basic Docker Network Commands**

1. **Create a new network**:
   ```bash
   docker network create <network_name>
   ```
   This command creates a custom network where you can place multiple containers.

2. **Inspect a container's network settings**:
   ```bash
   docker inspect <container_id>
   ```
   You can use this command to get detailed network information, including IP addresses and network configurations.

3. **Remove a network**:
   ```bash
   docker network rm <network_name>
   ```
   This command deletes a Docker network. Be sure no containers are connected before removing it.

4. **List all networks**:
   ```bash
   docker network ls
   ```
   This lists all the networks available on your Docker host.

5. **Connect a container to a network**:
   ```bash
   docker network connect <network_name> <container_name>
   ```
   You can attach an existing container to a specific network using this command.

6. **Disconnect a container from a network**:
   ```bash
   docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_name>
   ```

### 🚀 **Running Containers on Custom Networks**

- To run a container and connect it to a specific network, use:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --name busybox2 --network <network_name> busybox
   ```
   This command runs an interactive terminal in the `busybox` container and connects it to the specified network.

- For running a container in detached mode:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name <container_name> --network <network_name> <image_name>
   ```
   This runs a container in the background, connected to the specified network.

### 🌐 **Visualizing Docker Networking**

Docker's default **bridge** network works like this:

```
----------------------------
         bridge
----------------------------
           |
           |
           |
           -----
             docker
```

When you launch containers, they are assigned an IP address within the bridge network. For instance, `veth0` might be assigned the IP `172.17.0.2`:

```
docker    |    docker
               con2
               con3  
con1
veth0
172.17.0.2
```

To make these containers communicate, ensure they are all part of the same network. You can use the `docker network connect` command to ensure they share the same local network.

With these commands and concepts, you’ll be able to manage Docker networking more effectively and ensure your containers can communicate with each other seamlessly. Happy Docking! 🐳
